## Instructions to help you get going

### NextJS

- This project is based on React and NextJS.
- Make sure to read the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) to better understand what is going on.

### Server

- This app consumes a GraphQL API available at [https://github.com/guicostaarantes/psi-server](https://github.com/guicostaarantes/psi-server).
- It is recommended to clone this repo and run it with `docker-compose up --build` so that you can fully test the features on the web client.

### Folder structure

- `./public`: static served files, [following NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).
- `./src/pages`: a place for React components that represent whole pages of the application. [Following NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages), the route structure of the app will mimic the file structure under this folder.
- `./src/styleguide`: a place for React components that are small and likely to be used in other React components multiple times, such as a Button, an Input, etc.
- `./src/components`: a place for React components that are larger and not likely to be used in other React components multiple times, and also do not constitute the whole of a page, such as the login form, the registration form, etc.
- `./src/hooks`: a place for React custom hooks that are likely to be used in other React components multiple times.
- `./src/constants`: a place for numeric or string constants that are likely to be used multiple times in other files.
- `./src/graphql`: a place for GraphQL queries and mutations that shall be used in React components by the @apollo/client library.

### Component structure

- Every React component and hook is described in a folder with two files: `index.tsx` and `spec.tsx`.
- `index.tsx` files hold all the information for rendering the component (logic, markup and styles).
- Styles are delivered by using `<style jsx>` tags, [following NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js).
- `spec.tsx` files hold the tests for the React component or hook in the `index.tsx` file in the same folder.

### Environment variables

- Following NextJS documentation, environment variables for development purposes are declared in `./.env.development`. Set all necessary environment variables in this file so it can be used as a reference as to what environment variables to set when deploying in production.
- If you'd like to deploy this project manually, an easy way to set the environment variables for the production environment is to create a file `./.env.production` with the same keys as `./.env.development`. However remember not to commit this file to the repo as it probably contains secret information.
- [Following NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables), in order to make an environment variable public (appear in the code client-side), prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### State management

- State management in this application is handled by the [@hookstate/core](https://hookstate.js.org/docs/getting-started) library.
- This library provides a simple API for state that needs to be shared between multiple components. For global states, it is not necessary to wrap the whole application in a provider like the Context API.
- Global states should be handled by a custom hook in `./src/hooks`. Check `useToast` for an example.

### Import statements

- Import statements have absolute paths, [following NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases). The `@src/` prefix references the src folder. Do not use `../` in your imports as it makes the code less readable and movable.
- If you are using VSCode, install the `mike-co.import-sorter` extension that will help you organize your import statements.

### Linting

- You may run `yarn lint` to check all your files for static and formatting errors.
- If you are using VSCode, install the `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` and `esbenp.prettier-vscode` extensions that will help you lint and organize your code.

### Unit testing

- You may run `yarn test` to run all the spec.tsx files.
- If you are using VSCode, install the `orta.vscode-jest` extension that runs the tests as you save the files.

### VSCode

- This repo has extension recommendations and settings if you are using VSCode. Make sure to use them for a better programming experience.
